    "Another month, another Mojo release.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I am busy doing the 2023 edition of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) (AoC) in Mojo, and had a few complaints ðŸ˜….  \n",
    "If you not familiar with the AoC, it's basically a coding advent calendar that gives you a new coding challenge every day for the first 25 days of December.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In a bit of foreshadowing, I used an AoC 2022 puzzle in my [first post on Mojo](https://fnands.com/mojo-advent-of-code/), which was using Mojo 0.2.1, and it is encouraging to see how far the language has come.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The AoC puzzles are often pretty heavy in string wrangling, a task that Python is pretty strong in, and that Mojo is still somewhat lacking in. \n",
    "One of the features that I found was lacking in Mojo 0.5.0 was the ability to easily split a string as one does in Python.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the first day, I found myself needing to split a string by newlines, something which you can do trivially in Python by calling `my_string.split('\\n')`. In Mojo 0.5.0 this did not exist and I had to write a struct to implement this functionality. I ended up generalizing it a bit and putting it in a [library](https://github.com/fnands/advent_of_code_2023/blob/main/aoc_lib/string_utils.mojo) as it was super useful for the following days as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "And then on the fourth of December [Mojo 0.6.0 was released](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/changelog.html#v0.6.0-2023-12-04), which now includes the ability to call `.split()` on a string, as well as a bunch of useful Python methods (`rfind()`, `len()`, `str()`, `int()`). These will definitely help going forward with the AoC challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'll write a rundown of my experience with the AoC in Mojo when I complete all the puzzles, so now on the the spotlighted feature from 0.6.0: traits\n",

    "## Traits in Mojo\n",
    "\n",
    "[Traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_(computer_programming)) are a fairly common concept in programming languages, and allow you to add required functionality to a struct if it conforms to this trait. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, take the `len()` function that we know and love from Python, and that is also now a part of Mojo. \n",
    "The trait associated with `len()` in Mojo is `Sized`, meaning that any struct conforming to the `Sized` trait is required to have a `__len__()` method that returns an integer size. When the function `len()` is applied to a struct that conforms to `Sized`, the `__len__()` function is called. \n",
    "\n",
