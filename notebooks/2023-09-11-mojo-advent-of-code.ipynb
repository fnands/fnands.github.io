    "The [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/mojo) programming language was officially released in May, but could only be used through some notebooks in a sandbox.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, the [SDK](https://www.modular.com/blog/mojo-its-finally-here) (version 0.2.1) got released, so I decided to give it a look.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Mojo's goal is to *\"combine the usability of Python with the performance of C\"*, and bills itself as *\"the programming language for all AI developers\"*.   \n",
    "\n",
    "It's clear that Python is the dominant language when it comes to ML/AI, with great libraries like Pytorch and a few others being the main drivers of that. The problem comes with depth: all the fast libraries in Python are written in a performant language, usually C or C++, which means that if you want to dig into the internals of the tools you are using you have to switch languages, which greatly raises the barrier of entry for doing so.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are other languages that try to go for the usability of Python while retaining performance, and the first language that comes to mind for me in this respect is Julia. Julia is a pretty neat language, and writing math-heavy, fast code in it feels very elegant, while retaining a very Python like syntax. Julia is about twenty years younger than Python, and to me seems like they took the best aspects of Python and Fortran and rolled them into one language, allowing you to have performant and elegant code that is Julia all the way down. Given all this, in vacuum, Julia would seem like the obvious language to choose when it comes to ML/AI programming.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The one major downside of Julia is that it doesn't have the robust ecosystem of libraries that Python has, and unless something major changes, it seems that Python will keep winning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Enter Mojo, a language that then (aspires to) keep interoperability with Python, while itself being very performant and allowing you to write code that is Mojo all the way down. Basically if Mojo achieves its goals then we get to have our cake and eat it: we can keep the great ecosystem of packages that Python brings with it, while getting to write new performant code in a single. My guess is if this works out that all the major packages will eventually get rewritten in Mojo, but we can have a transition period where we still get to keep the C/C++ version of them until this can be done.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The people behind Mojo (mostly [Chris Lattner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner)) seem to know what they are doing, so I wish them all the best. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can view the notebook for this blog post on Github: [![View On GitHub](../assets/github.svg)](https://github.com/fnands/fnands.github.io/blob/main/notebooks/2023-09-11-mojo-advent-of-code.ipynb)"

    "\n",
    "I wanted to start with something basic, so I thought I would have a look at the first puzzle from the [2022 advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022). Basically you are given a text file with a several lists of numbers representing the amount of calories some elves are carrying (go read up on the advent of code if you are unfamiliar, it will make sense then), and have to find which elves are carrying the most calories.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So effectively a little bit of file parsing, with some basic arithmetic, i.e. a little puzzle to ease into Mojo. I won't share the input because the creator of the AoC has [explicitly asked people not to](https://x.com/ericwastl/status/1465805354214830081?s=20), but you can download your own and try the code below. \n",

Right now, there seems to be no direct way to go from `int` to `Int`, so I had to take a detour via `float64`.   \n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Mojo feels relatively familiar, but I will also say that when writing \"pure\" Mojo it feels like writing C++ with Python syntax. \n",
    "This makes sense given the goals of the language, but caught me a little off guard; I was expecting something a little closer to Julia, which still feels a lot like Python in most cases.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This was not the greatest example to show Mojo off, as Mojo really shines in high performance environments, so the language didn't really get to stretch its legs here. You can find some more [performance oriented examples on the official Mojo website](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/notebooks/Matmul.html).   \n",
    "\n",
    "I will probably give Mojo another look and try out something a bit more suited for the language in the future, maybe when the `0.3` version of the language drops.   \n",
    "\n",
    "I think I've been spoiled by mostly writing in two well supported languages (Python and C++) for which there are countless reference examples or StackOverflow posts on how to do things. Due to the fact that Mojo is brand new, there are very few examples to look to about how to do even relatively basic things. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now if you want to get started, I recommend starting with the [exercises on mojodojo.dev](https://mojodojo.dev/guides/intro-to-mojo/basic-types.html#exercises). \n"
